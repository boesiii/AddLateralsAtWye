Add Lateral at Wye Plugin for Qgis 

This plugin adds perpendicular lateral lines from existing wyes (points) along a main sewer.  The main sewer file needs to have two attributes CLOCK and DIRECTION.  The clock attribute indicates the clock direction of the lateral when looking at the main.  The DIRECTION attribute indicates what manhole or structure the clock direction is referencing.
